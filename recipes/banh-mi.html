    <ul> 
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Jicama</li>
        <li>Onion</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine carrots, jicama, and onion in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup vinegar, water, and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir until sugar dissolves, about 1 minute. 
            Remove from heat and pour pickling liquid over the vegetables. Let sit for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk remaining 1/4 cup vinegar with fish sauce, soy sauce, sriracha, garlic powder, five-spice powder, salt, and pepper in a 10-inch sauté pan over 
            medium heat. Bring to a boil for about 3 minutes. Lower heat to medium, add mushrooms, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. 
            Remove mushrooms from liquid with a slotted spoon.
        </li>
        <li>Spread 1 tablespoon mayonnaise over each roll half. Divide mushrooms evenly over the two bottom halves. Drain pickled vegetables and divide evenly over 
            mushrooms. Divide cucumber, jalapeño, and cilantro between the sandwiches. Add more sriracha if desired. Squeeze 1 lime wedge over filling of each 
            sandwich and cover with top bun half.
